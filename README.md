Both videos in the home directory are for the video submission. Having them as 1 file was too big to uplaod to the repo.

The game doesn't really have a title, but its about getting you and your ally to the top of the screen. 
It is supposed to be a short puzzle game. 
I tried my best to incorperate the strange movement that i was getting due to the netcode into a fun experience of working together.

The 6 sounds in the game are:
* On spawn in
* Trigger for moving the red pipes
* That other trigger that removes the last horizontal pipe
* Standing on the thing that repositions the screen
* Death
* Winning the game
